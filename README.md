# Log-Analysis
Log Analysis of my semester thesis at the BFH for the BFH FAIR Robotic Arm

## paper.py

is the main script. runs log_parser and get_analysis and then makes the plots which are in the paper.

## log_parser.py

parses the log data of each user and generates csv files of each mode and a summary.csv file with the duration in the modi

## get_analysis.py

takes the generated csv files from log_parser.py and extracts numerical / quantitative data and puts it into analysis.csv

## /data

contains a folder for each date that has log data from the study

Note: this folder has to added from the polybox
